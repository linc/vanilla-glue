SUMMARY
=======
These plugins are for experienced web developers who want to add WordPress to a Vanilla Forum community with 
synched users, synched comments, no iframes, and the smoothest user experience.

It is primarily for *Vanilla* developers, not WordPress developers. It essentially borgs WordPress into being
a convenient CMS addon to Vanilla and enables Vanilla framework use within your WordPress theme.

WARNING
=======
If you already have an existing WordPress site and just installed a new Vanilla forum, this *IS NOT* the plugin for you. 
See the "VanillaForums" plugin for WordPress instead.

Glue will forcefully sync your WordPress Users table to your Vanilla User table. 
This means existing WordPress-only users WILL BE DELETED FOREVER. Even your WordPress admin users will be deleted. 
You will log in with your Vanilla admin account after install.
